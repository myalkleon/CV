# CV (Artem Lomakin)
My first project.  
It is deployed and you can visit it at the [link](https://myalkleon.github.io/CV/).  
It will not be upgraded for me to look at this after many years :)  
## Some intersting facts about it's stack:
- Webpack for comfortable builds and "deploy" (due to GitHub Pages project settings, files in "docs" dir of master branch are used for deploy;
- Webpack dev server for live reload and hmr;
- Sass loader for easy scss webpack-bases transpiling;
- Typed.js for typing imitation;
- Promise-based loading scenario function, which is executed only when all content is ready for show; 
- Responsive layout.
